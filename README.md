Data_Cleaning_Assignment


This is the course project for the Getting & Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Loads the activity and feature data.
2. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which    reflect a mean or standard deviation.
3. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those    columns with the dataset.
4. Merges the two datasets
5. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors.
6. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each    variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file "tidy.txt".
